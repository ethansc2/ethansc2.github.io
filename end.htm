	<h1>Efficiency of different automotive fuel types.</h1>
	<br>
	Electricity is by far the most efficient fuel type.
	<br>
	Electric cars average highway MPG is 181% greater than that of gasoline and 112% greater than that of diesel.
	<br>
	Electric cars average city MPG is 510% greater than that of gasoline and 387% greater than that of diesel.
	<br>
	<br>
	The difference in mean between diesel and gasoline under the 5% significance level is only significant for city MPG,
	<br>
	while the difference for highway MPG is not significant. Due to the small sample size of diesel cars, this could indicate
	<br>
	that there may not be a large difference between the true means for diesel and gasoline cars.
